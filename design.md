# Portfolio Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern developer portfolios like those found on Linear, Notion, and GitHub, emphasizing clean aesthetics with strong typography and strategic use of color to showcase technical expertise.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Background: 220 15% 8% (dark charcoal)
- Surface: 220 15% 12% (elevated dark)
- Text Primary: 220 15% 95% (near white)
- Text Secondary: 220 10% 70% (muted gray)

**Accent Colors:**
- Brand Primary: 210 100% 60% (vibrant blue)
- Success: 142 76% 36% (green for certifications)
- Warning: 38 92% 50% (orange for highlights)

**Gradients:**
- Hero background: Subtle gradient from 220 15% 8% to 220 20% 4%
- Project cards: Gentle blue gradient overlays (210 100% 60% to 250 100% 70%)

### Typography
**Font Families:**
- Primary: Inter (Google Fonts) for clean, modern readability
- Accent: JetBrains Mono for code snippets and technical details

**Hierarchy:**
- Hero Title: text-5xl font-bold
- Section Headers: text-3xl font-semibold
- Body Text: text-base font-normal
- Captions: text-sm font-medium

### Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Consistently use Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 (p-4, m-6, gap-8, py-12, px-16)

### Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Fixed top navigation with glassmorphism effect
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Mobile hamburger menu

**Hero Section:**
- Full-viewport height with centered content
- Professional headshot (circular, subtle border)
- Animated typing effect for role description
- Primary CTA button with blur background over gradient

**Project Cards:**
- Grid layout with hover lift effects
- Project screenshots with overlay gradients
- Technology tags with rounded badges
- GitHub and live demo links

**Skills Section:**
- Icon grid with technology logos
- Progress indicators for proficiency levels
- Grouped by category (Frontend, Backend, Tools)

**Timeline:**
- Vertical timeline for certifications
- Color-coded by completion status
- Certificate preview on hover

### Images
- **Hero Image:** Professional headshot (400x400px, circular crop)
- **Project Screenshots:** High-quality previews of Future AI and GitHub projects
- **Technology Icons:** From established icon libraries (Font Awesome or Heroicons)
- **Background Elements:** Subtle geometric patterns or code-inspired graphics

### Animations
- **Minimal and purposeful:** Fade-in on scroll, subtle hover effects
- **Loading states:** Skeleton screens for project data
- **Micro-interactions:** Button hover states, card elevation changes

### Design Principles
1. **Technical Credibility:** Clean, developer-focused aesthetic that builds trust
2. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear information architecture guiding users through your expertise
3. **Performance:** Optimized images and minimal animation for fast loading
4. **Accessibility:** High contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly

This design approach balances professional presentation with technical authenticity, perfect for showcasing your Python and web development expertise to potential employers and collaborators.
